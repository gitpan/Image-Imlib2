Image::Imlib2

Image::Imlib2 is a Perl port of Imlib2, a graphics library that does
image file loading and saving as well as manipulation, arbitrary
polygon support, etc. It does ALL of these operations FAST. It allows
you to create colour images using a large number of graphics
primitives, and output the images in a range of formats.


NOTES

Note that this is the first version of my attempt at a Perl interface
to Imlib2. Currently, the API is just to test things out. Not
everything is supported, but a great deal of functionality already
exists. If you think the API can be tweaked to be a bit more
intuitive, drop me a line!


INSTALLATION

Note that a development version of Imlib2 must be installed before
installing this module. In order to do this, please follow these steps:

export CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@cvs.enlightenment.org:/cvs/enlightenment"
cvs login # hit return after this when you get a password prompt
cvs -z3 co edb
cvs -z3 co imlib2

cd edb/
./autogen.sh
make
make install

cd ../imlib2
./autogen.sh
make
make install

... and that should install the Imlib2 C library for you.

You install Image::Imlib2, as you would install any Perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test     
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of Image::Imlib2 in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl


DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in Imlib2.pm. POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility, as 'perldoc Image::Imlib2'.
